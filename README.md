# text-based-adventure
A Harry Potter inspired text based adventure game written entirely in Python.

NOTE: This project was pushed to Github after the development process was completed.

# About
I've been a Harry Potter fan my whole life. I've always loved how expansive and descriptive the "wizarding world" was in the novels,
so I wanted to recreate the universe in a game. This game replicates the first 5 chapters of "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's 
Stone" by J.K. Rowling. Players can navigate through text excepts of these chapters, eventually arriving at an interactive version
of Chapter 5: Diagon Alley. A player, as Harry Potter, can explore the world of Diagon Alley through text commands, while on a 
scavenger hunt for magical school supplies. 

# Start the Game
